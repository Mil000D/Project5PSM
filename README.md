# Moon Trajectory Simulation

## Program Description
This repository contains a simulation program that calculates data that can be used to plot the trajectory of the Moon relative to the Sun.
The simulation is based on solving the equations that describe the movement of the Earth around the Sun and the Moon relative to the Earth.
The simulation utilizes the improved Euler method (MidPoint).

## Usage
1. Run the program.
2. Adjust the input values as desired.
3. Run the calculations.
4. Copy the generated data to Excel for example to visualize the motion of the Moon relative to the Sun.
